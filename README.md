# YTDLP_CLI
Does what it says on the tin. As of the current (2023-12-30) version of YTDLP, it makes the basic command line changes so you don't have to.
Just answer Y/N or 1/2/3 to a couple things and it'll do the rest.

# Installation:
1) download the main .bat and DefaultLocation.txt files and place them into the same folder as the YTDLP .exe file
2) open DefaultLocation.txt and change the directory to whatever folder you want to save videos to ex: C:\Path\to\save\folder (by default it's the user's video folder)
4) open the bat file



 Made because I got tired of trying to remember which settings did what every time.
 Excuse the terrible code, it was my first time writing anything more complex than a basic webpage
