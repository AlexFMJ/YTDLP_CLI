# YTDLP_CLI
Does what it says on the tin. As of the current (2023-07-12) version of YTDLP, it makes all the necessary command line changes so you don't have to.
Just answer Y/N or 1/2/3 to a couple things and it'll do the rest.


made because I got tired of trying to remember which settings did what every time

excuse the terrible code, it was my first time writing anything more complex than a basic webpage
